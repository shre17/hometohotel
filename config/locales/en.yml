        title: What’s expected of hosts?
        paragraph_1: We want to give you clear guidance so you know what’s expected and can provide a 5-star stay every time you share your home.
        paragraph_2: "We ask all hosts to meet five basic requirements: overall rating, response rate, cancellations, acceptance of reservations, and essential amenities. Beyond the basics, you’ll also get reviewed by guests who stay with you."
        paragraph_3: Already a host? Check your Progress to see how you’re doing.
      sub_heading_2:
        title: Basic requirements
        paragraph: To help create comfortable, reliable stays for guests, all homes and hosts must meet five basic requirements.
      sub_heading_3:
        title: Be responsive
        paragraph: Responding quickly when guests reach out shows that you’re an attentive and considerate host. How frequently and quickly you respond to reservation requests and booking inquiries is measured by your response rate. We ask hosts to respond to these types of messages within 24 hours.
      sub_heading_4:
        title: Accept reservation requests
        paragraph: No guest likes to have to send 4 or 5 requests to find an available place so we expect that if your calendar shows you’re free, you accept most requests. Make sure your listing’s calendar reflects the days you’re able to host. This way you’re more likely to get reservation requests that you can actually accommodate. You can use your availability settings to block time off between bookings, or to prevent requests for same-day reservations or reservations too far in the future.
      sub_heading_5:
        title: Avoid cancelling on guests
        paragraph: We take cancellations seriously and ask all hosts to avoid cancelling on guests–their travel plans depend on it! You’ll be subject to penalties, including financial penalties, if you cancel a confirmed booking. We ask that you avoid canceling confirmed bookings unless there are extenuating circumstances.
      sub_heading_6:
        title: Get positive reviews
        paragraph_1: Guests like to know they can expect a consistent level of quality, no matter where they book. At the end of each stay, guests will review their experience with you, which is one of the ways we evaluate you as a host. Your overall rating is your average review score from all the guests you’ve hosted.
        paragraph_2: As a host, you’ll have an opportunity to rate guests too–on their cleanliness, courteousness, and communication. Your feedback helps us ensure that guests are treating the homes they stay in as if they were their own. Guests who are consistently flagged by hosts may be subject to penalties.
      sub_heading_7:
        title: Getting great reviews from guests
        paragraph: "We’ve found that hosts who get great reviews tend to focus on four things: cleanliness, accurate listing details, a smooth check-in, and proactive communication."
      sub_heading_8:
        title: Cleanliness
        paragraph_1: Guests will expect the clean and tidy space they see in your listing photos. Make sure you give yourself enough time to clean between guests, especially when you have back-to-back bookings.

        list_item_2: Charge a cleaning fee and use the extra money to pay for cleaning supplies or hire a professional cleaning service
        list_item_3: Leave cleaning supplies in your space so your guests can take care of spills and accidental messes

      sub_heading_12:
        title: Accurate listing details
        paragraph_1: Setting the right expectations before a trip can contribute to a better experience for both you and your guests. You can help travelers decide if your space meets their needs by providing clear info and must-know details like whether you allow pets. A detailed listing and profile helps attract the guests who are looking for a place just like yours.
        paragraph_2: Guests will have the opportunity to rate the accuracy of the information you provide.

          list_item_1: Use a variety of high-quality photos with captions and write a detailed description of the space
          list_item_2: Provide House Rules that address situations that will matter to your guests. Your rules can provide clarity around what you do and don’t allow, like smoking, pets, or additional visitors.
          list_item_3: Let guests know if there are parts of the listing that are off-limits, like a garage or the attic
          list_item_4: Be honest about unexpected factors that will impact your guests’ stay. Your guests deserve to know if your neighbors just started a noisy construction project or if they’ll have to climb 8 flights of stairs to get to your place.
      sub_heading_14:
        title: AMENITIES

        list_item_3: If you offer self check-in, add those details in the Guest resources section of your listing
        list_item_4: Make sure your guests know how to contact you if they have a travel delay or last-minute question
        list_item_5: Provide your guests with detailed directions for getting to your place—you can save time by putting it all in your house manual
      sub_heading_18:
        title: Supporting guests during their stay
        paragraph: Whether or not you’re staying in the space with your guests, it’s important to remain available throughout their stay. Your guests will have the opportunity to rate the clarity and consistency of your communication at the end of their stay—and the average of these guest ratings will appear on your listing page.
      sub_heading_19:
        title: TIPS
        list_item_1: Be proactive in your communication so guests know you’re available. Reach out early to coordinate arrival plans. If you won’t be greeting your guests when they arrive, you can send them a message at their check-in time to make sure everything went smoothly.
